# Vault Lifecycle

Vaults operate in 3 main phases:

1. **Deposit**: Users send USDC or supported tokens into the vault and receive Vault Tokens.
2. **Trading**: The manager executes trades using the vault’s funds, aiming to generate yield against Adrena’s peer-to-pool mechanism.
3. **Redemption**: Investors redeem their Vault Tokens for their share of the vault, with profits net of the manager's performance fee.
