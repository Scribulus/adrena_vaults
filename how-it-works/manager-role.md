# Manager Role

The Vault Manager is responsible for all trading operations. They cannot withdraw user funds, but can execute trades against Adrenaâ€™s pool.

Managers configure vault parameters like:
- Profit share (e.g. 10%)
- Lockup time
- Accepted assets
- Max TVL

Their profit comes as a percentage of performance when users redeem.
