# Investor Role

Investors deposit USDC (or supported tokens) into a vault to receive Vault Tokens.

These tokens:
- Represent their share of the vaultâ€™s total NAV
- Accrue value when the manager makes successful trades
- Can be redeemed at any time (unless a lock applies)

Investors earn passively while the manager executes strategy.
