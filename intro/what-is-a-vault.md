# What is an Adrena Vault?

An Adrena Vault is a smart contract-based container of capital where users deposit funds (e.g. USDC), and a manager trades those funds against Adrena’s liquidity pool.

Vaults generate profits via the manager's trading strategies, and the performance is reflected in the vault’s net asset value (NAV). Depositors hold Vault Tokens representing their proportional share, redeemable at any time (subject to lockups).
