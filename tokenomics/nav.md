# What is NAV?

**NAV** stands for **Net Asset Value**.

It represents the total value of a vault divided by the number of Vault Tokens issued:


NAV per token = Total Vault Value / Total Vault Token Supply

When the manager earns profits, the vaultâ€™s value grows, and so does the NAV per token. Redeeming tokens gives the investor their proportional share of this value.
