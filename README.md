# Adrena Vaults

Documentation for the Adrena Vault System (Basic Version).

This document outlines how Adrena Vaults work, their benefits for users and managers, and how they interact with the Adrena peer-to-pool trading model.

For now, this version covers the basic "Vault-as-a-Trader" model, where a vault manager executes trades and investors receive a share of profits.
